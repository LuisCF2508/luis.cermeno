1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-height

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. input each person's height, sum height, and count each person
4. calculate average height = sum / count
5. output average height

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt "Enter one person's height in cm [0-250 or -1 if there are no more people]: "
-label "The average height of everyone in the classroom is " and averageHeight

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-height = each student's height (integer) valid values [0-250]
-sum = total of all the people's height in the classroom (integer)
-count = total number of people in the classroom (integer)
-averageHeight = average height of everyone in the room (decimal) formatted to 1 digit past the decimal point

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set sum = 0
20 set count = 0
25 set averageHeight = 0.0
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***input each person's height, sum each height, and count each person
40 output "Enter one person's height in cm [0-250 or -1 if there are no more people]: "
50 input height
55 if height = -1 then skip to 90
57 if height < 0 or height > 250 output "Invalid input, please try again", then skip to instruction 40
60 sum = sum + height
70 count = count + 1
80 skip to instruction 40
***calculate the average height
90 if count > 0 then averageHeight = sum / count
***output result
100 output "The average height of everyone in the room is " and averageHeight
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: purpose: simple and most common test case
              input: 160, 170, 180
              expected results: The average height of everyone in the room is 170.0
10 sum = 0
20 count = 0
25 averageHeight=0.0
30 objective:  Calculate the average height of everyone in the room.
   Author: Luis Cermeno
   user instructions: You will be asked to input everyone's height to get the average height.
40 Enter one person's height in cm [0-250 or -1 if there are no more people]: 
50 height = 160
55 false
60 sum = 0 + 160 = 160
70 count = 0 + 1 = 1
80 skip to instruction 40
40 Enter one person's height in cm [0-250 or -1 if there are no more people]: 
50 height = 170
55 false
60 sum = 160 + 170 = 330
70 count = 1 + 1 = 2
80 skip to instruction 40
40 Enter one person's height in cm [0-250 or -1 if there are no more people]: 
50 height = 180
55 false
60 sum = 330 + 180 = 510
70 count = 2 + 1 = 3
80 skip to instruction 40
40 Enter one person's height in cm [0-250 or -1 if there are no more people]: 
50 height = -1
55 skip to instruction 90
90 averageHeight = sum / count = 510 / 3 = 170.0
100 The average height of everyone in the room is 170.0
999 END

Test case #2: purpose: no people in the room test case
              input = -1
              expected result = The average height of everyone in the room is 0.0
10 sum = 0
20 count = 0
25 averageHeight=0.0
30 objective:  Calculate the average height of everyone in the room.

Test case #3: purpose: invalid input made by the user test case
                      input = 300
                      expected result = message alerting that user has not entered a valid value for height
