1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Calculate the average age of everyone in the room.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-age

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. input each person's age, sum each age, and count each person
4. calculate average age = sum / count
5. output average age

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt "How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if there are no more people]: "
-label "The average age of everyone in the room is " and averageAge

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-age = each person's age (integer) valid values [0-122]
-sum = total of all the people's ages in the room (integer)
-count = total number of people in the room (integer)
-averageAge = average age of everyone in the room (decimal) formatted to 1 digit past the decimal point

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set sum = 0
20 set count = 0
25 set averageAge = 0.0
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***input each person's age, sum each age, and count each person
40 output "How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: "
50 input age
55 if age = -1 then skip to 90
57 if age < 0 or age > 122 then skip to instruction 40
60 sum = sum + age
70 count = count + 1
80 skip to instruction 40
***calculate the average age
90 if count > 0 then averageAge = sum / count
***output result
100 output "The average age of everyone in the room is " and averageAge
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: purpose: simplest and expected test case
              input: 21, 33, 44
              expected results: The average age of everyone in the room is 32.6
10 sum = 0
20 count = 0
25 averageAge=0.0
30 objective:  Calculate the average age of everyone in the room.
   Author: Teacher 
   user instructions: You will be asked to input everyone's age to get the average age.
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: 
50 age = 21
55 false
60 sum = 0 + 21 = 21
70 count = 0 + 1 = 1
80 skip to instruction 40
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: 
50 age = 33
55 false
60 sum = 21 + 33 = 54
70 count = 1 + 1 = 2
80 skip to instruction 40
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: 
50 age = 44
55 false
60 sum = 54 + 44 = 98
70 count = 2 + 1 = 3
80 skip to instruction 40
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: 
50 age = -1
55 skip to instruction 90
90 averageAge = sum / count = 98 / 3 = 32.6
100 The average age of everyone in the room is 32.6
999 END

Test case #2: purpose: what if there are no people in the room?
              input = -1
              expected result = The average age of everyone in the room is 0.0
10 sum = 0
20 count = 0
25 averageAge=0.0
30 objective:  Calculate the average age of everyone in the room.
   Author: Teacher 
   user instructions: You will be asked to input everyone's age to get the average age.
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: 
50 age = -1
55 skip to instruction 90
90 false
100 The average age of everyone in the room is 0.0
999 END

COMENT: Test successfully passed and completed.

Test case #3: purpose: not a valid value for age
                      input = 125
                      expected result = not a valid value for age

10 sum = 0
20 count = 0
25 averageAge=0.0
30 objective:  Calculate the average age of everyone in the room.
   Author: Teacher 
   user instructions: You will be asked to input everyone's age to get the average age.
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]: 
50 age = 125
55 false
57 skip to instruction 40
40 How old are you in years [0-122 or -1 if no more people]:

COMENT: The algorithm should have a brach in which a label is printed saying "Invalid input please try again"
, this way the user will understand why the program is asking for an input again so that he won't end up lost.
