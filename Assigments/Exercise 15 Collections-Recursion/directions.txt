1. Write myFibonacci-algorithm.txt to calculate a value in the "Fibonacci number" series. This series is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,.., where 0 is the zeroth number in the series, 1 is
the first, 1 is the second, and so on. Note that for each number after the opening 0 and 1, the value equals the sum of the two values that precede it. For example, 13 + 21 = 34.
Input from the console keyboard: one number, a sequence number equal to zero or greater. Output: all the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to and including the sequence number separated by a space, and on a second line output the Fibonacci number corresponding to the sequence number input.

2. Write myFibonacci.cpp from myFibonacci-algorithm.txt using recursion.
So here's what we know: the Fibonacci number for index 0 or 1 equals the index. There are no negative index values -- you can ignore that possibility. The Fibonacci number for any other index
equals the sum of the Fibonacci numbers for the index-1 and the index-2.
The program should prompt the user for an series index (greater or equal to zero) and print the
Fibonacci number corresponding to that index.

For example your program's partial console input and output should look something like this:
Enter an index [0 or greater]: 6
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 
The Fibonacci number at index 6 is 8.
