user Instructions: You will be prompted for 4 numbers to get the average and how many of those numbers are above the average.
prompt1: "Please enter a number [0-100]: "
label1: "The average of "
label2: " numbers is "
label3: ".  "
label4: " numbers are greater than the average."

--Data
array-Numbers defined for 4 values-->>stores 4 input values from the user (integer)
average-->>calculated average of 4 values input (decimal)
nGreater-->>calculated number of input values that are greater than the calculated average (integer)
sum-->>sum of input values (integer)
count-->>count input values (integer)
i-->>loop iteration index (integer)
