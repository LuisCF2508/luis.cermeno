1. Create nameSorter-algorithm.txt to read names in a text file, sort them
alphabetically, and output them to the screen with these specifications:
A. The names are to be stored in an input text file, one name per line. 
B. Prompt the user to enter the filename via the console keyboard.
C. Skip any blank lines that may be in the input file.
D. Skip any exact duplicates that may be in the input file.
E. Allow up to 5 names. Stop reading the file after the end-of-file is reached, or the 5th name is
added and the list reaches its capacity.
F. Sort the list alphabetically, from A to Z, according to the first letter in the name string. The sorting and checking for duplicates should both be case-independent. But do not permanently convert the name case -- compare lowercase (or uppercase) versions of the
text for sorting purposes only.

2. Write nameSorter.cpp from nameSorter-algorithm.txt
Example partial output:

Enter the name of the file containing names: myFriends.txt
Alex
beth
Carl
Pat
Sasha

 

3. Write mp3Shuffler1-algorithm.txt to read all song titles from a text file,
and randomly select and output titles in a loop until the user wishes to stop, with these specifications:
A. The song titles are to be stored in an input text file named songs.txt, one name per line.
B. Allow up to 200 song titles. 
C. Stop reading the file after the end-of-file is reached, or the 200th song title is added and the list reaches its capacity.
D. In a loop, prompt the user to “play a song [Y/N]?”. If the reply is N (or n), exit the loop and let the program end. If the reply is Y (or y), randomly choose a number for the index of the song title in the
list to play. Print the song title, and repeat to the top of the loop.

4. Write mp3Shuffler1.cpp from mp3Shuffler1-algorithm.txt using an array based list of capacity 200.
Example partial output:

play a song [Y/N]?: y
Hey Jude
play a song [Y/N]?: y
Imagine
play a song [Y/N]?: y
Johnny B. Goode
play a song [Y/N]?: y
Respect
play a song [Y/N]?: y
Good Vibrations
play a song [Y/N]?: y
Johnny B. Goode
play a song [Y/N]?: n
