1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.
2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userGuess

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions and generation a ramdom number between 1 and 10
2. user introduction
3. game loop where either the user guesses and gets feedback, or exits the game.


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: "Objective: Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10."
-user introduction: "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10."
-prompt: "What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?"
-user feedback: "Try again..." or "You guessed it!" or in case of invalid input "I really want a number between 1 and 10."


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-target (integer): a ramdom number from 1 to 10 generated by the computer 
-userGuess (integer): number guessed by the user.

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***Data
10 initialize ramdom number generator and set target to random number between 1 and 10
***Introduction 
20 output introduction: "Objective: Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. Author: Luis Cermeno"
30 output "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10."
***Game loop where either the user guesses and gets feedback or exits the game.
40 output prompt "What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?"
50 input userGuess
60 if userGuess is equal 0 the skip to instruction 999
70 if userGuess < 1 or userGuess > 10 then output "I really want a number between 1 and 10"
80 if userGuess is equal to target then output "You guessed it!" else "Try again..."
90 skip to instruction 40

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1
-purpose: test two cases of failing the guess, one of invalid input and one of correct guess
-input: userGuess = 5, 3, 11, 7.
-expected reults: "Try Again", "Try Again", "I really want a number between 1 and 10", "You guessed it!"
-execution:
10 target = 7
20 Objective: Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. Author: Luis Cermeno
30 I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10.
40 What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?
50 userGuess = 5
60 False
70 False
80 Try again
90 skip to instruction 40
40 What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?
50 userGuess = 3
60 False
70 False
80 Try again
90 skip to instruction 40
40 What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?
50 userGuess = 11
60 False
70 I really want a number between 1 and 10
80 Try again
90 skip to instruction 40
40 What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?
50 userGuess = 7
60 False
70 False
80 You guessed it!
90 skip to instruction 40
999 END

Test case #2: 
purpose: test user inputting sentinel value
input: userGuess = 0
expected reults: End the program
execution:
10 target = 7
