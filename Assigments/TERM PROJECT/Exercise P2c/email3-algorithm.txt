1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Read user selected input file line by line and output to the console every valid email address as it is found.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-iFileName
-oFileName
-wait

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. get filenames (input and output) using variable prompts and default filenames and input validation
4. output filenames and pause program execution until user presses enter key
5. read input file and output emails


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, "This program will prompt you for two text file names, an input and an output file. The program will read you input file and then show the lines containing the character '@'.Please filetype the name of each file correctly including the extension .txt. No other file extension is yet supported.".
-prompt "Enter input filename [Press ENTER for default: " and dFileName " ]: "
-prompt "Enter output filename [Press ENTER for default: " and dFileName " ]: "
-inputValidation for iFileName "Sorry, that is an invalid name. The file name must have the .txt extension. Try again please." 
-output in case of no emails  "Sorry, no email addresses were found in the file" and value of iFileName
-output each value of anEmail.

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data filetype, formatting, or any other specifications):

-iFileName // (text) :  is the input file name <main>
-oFileName // (text) :  is the output file name <main>
-dFileName // (text) : is the default file name <main>
-wait // (text) : just a variable to read the ENTER key at the end of the program. <main>

-filetype // (text): is either "input" or "output" choice given to the subprogram "getFileName" <getFileName>
-dFileName // (text) : is the default file name given to the subprogram "getFileName" <getFileName>
-valid // (boolean) : is true when the input is already processed by validation function <getFileName>
-fileName // (text) : is the text entered by the user returned to the main program <getFileName>

-iFileName // (text): is the name of the input file given to the subprogram "readFile" <readFile>
-lineFromFile //(text) is a line read from the input file <readFile>
-nLines // (integer) number of lines of the file <readFile>
-nEmails // (integer) number of valid Email adresses in each line  <readFile>

-lineFromFile // (text) is a line read from the input file <readFile>
-i //(integer) is a counter used to process each character of the line and find an '@' <processLine>
-nEmails = 0 // (integer) number of valid Email adresses found, value returned to subprogram readFile program <processLine>
-s //(integer) is the character position in lineFromFile for the start of a possible email <processLine>
-e //(integer) is the character position in lineFromFile for the end of a possible email <processLine>
-dotPos //(integer) is the character number of lineFromFile in which the dot is <processLine>
-hasDot //(integer) is true if the possible email has a dot on their characters <processLine>
-anEmail //(string) is an sub string of lineFromFile that stores a complete valid email <processLine>

-c // (character) is a character from the possible email
-result // (boolean) is true if a character is a valid email character <isValidChar>


3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)

-->algorithm for subprogram "getFileName" : prompts for input for either input or output file names, also checks for default input
1010 set fileName = "No name"
1015 if filetype = "input" then output "Enter input filename [Press ENTER for default: " and dFileName " ]: " , otherwise if filetype = "input" then output "Enter output filename [Press ENTER for default: " and dFileName " ]: "
1020 input fileName
1025 if fileName length is 0 then fileName = dFileName and skip to line 1040,
1030 set valid to false
1035 if fileName length < 5 OR (character "fileName length-1" of fileName is different from 't') OR (character "fileName length-2" of fileName is different from 'x') OR (character "fileName length-3" of fileName is different from 't') OR (character "fileName length-4" of fileName is different from '.') then output "Sorry, that is an invalid name. The file name must have the .txt extension. Try again please.", otherwise set valid to true
1040 if valid = true the skip to line 1050
1045 go back to line 1015
1050 return to main program the value of fileName

-->algorithm for subprogram "readFile" : reads input file until EOF that calls function processLine for each line read from the input file
2010 set nLines = 0
2011 set nEmails = 0
2012 set hasDot = false
2015 open input file named as the value of iFileName
2020 if the file contain errors, skip to line 2060
2025 if end-of-file is reached skip to line 2050
2030 set lineFromFile = next line of the file
2035 go to subprogram processLine the set nEmails = value returned (give the value of lineFromFile as lineFromFile)
2040 nLines = nLines + 1
2045 go back to 2025
2050 if nEmails = 0 output "Sorry, no email addresses were found in the file" and value of iFileName
2060 return to main program

-->algorithm for subprogram "processLine"
3010 set nEmails = 0
3015 set i = 0
3020 if i >= lineFromFile length then skip to 3210
3030 if lineFromFile[i] is not @ skip to 3190
**Loop to traverse lineFromFile from the character @ to the left
3040 set s = i - 1
3050 if s = 0 skip to 3100
3060 go to subprogram isValidChar giving the value of lineFromFile[s], if value returned is true set s = s + 1 and skip to line 3100 
3070 s = s - 1
3090 go back to 3050
**Loop to traverse lineFromFile from the character @ to the right
3100 set e = i + 1
3110 if e = lineFromFile length skip to  3160
3120 go to subprogram isValidChar giving the value of lineFromFile[e] as c , if value returned is true set e = e - 1 and skip to line 3160
3130 if lineFromFile[e] = '.' then set hasDot to true and dotPos to e
3140 e = e + 1
3150 go back to 3110
**Decide whether to extract and output the email
3160 if (s < i) AND (e > i) AND (hasDot) AND (dotPos > i + 1) then set anEmail to the extracted characters (s-e) from lineFromFile, otherwise skip to 3190
3170 output anEmail
3180 nEmails = nEmails + 1
3190 i = i + 1
3200 go back to 3020
3210 return nEmails to subprogram readFile

-->algorithm for subprogram "isValidChar"
1010 set result true
2010 if c is not in the range of A-Z AND not in the range of a-z AND not in the range of 0-9 AND is NOT '_' AND '.' AND '-' AND '+' then set result to false
3010 return the value of result to subprogram processLine

-->algorithm for "main" program
***data
10 set dFileName = "fileContainingEmails.txt"
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***get filenames (input and output) using variable prompts and default filenames and input validation
30 set iFileName = fileName from subprogram "getFileName" (give the values of "input" as filetype and dFileName as dFileName)
35 if iFileName = dFileName then dFileName = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt", else dFileName = iFileName
40 set oFileName = fileName from subprogram "getFileName" (give the values of "output" as filetype and dFileName as dFileName)
***output file names
50 output label for the input file name, and iFileName
55 output label for the output file name, and oFileName
60 output a prompt to press ENTER key to continue
65 input wait
***read input file and output emails
70 go to subprogram readFile (give the value of iFileName as iFileName)
