1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Display an interactive cards game human vs. computer.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-playAgain

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. generation of random numbers 
4. output cards value and kind
5. output winner decision

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-output: "Computer's card is a " and computerValue " of " and computerSuit
-output: "Human's card is a " and humanValue " of " and humanSuit
-output "Human wins!" or "Computer wins!"
-prompt: "Want to play again?"


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-computerValue (integer) computer's card value,number between 2-14, 11 as Jack, 12 as Queen, 13 as King, and 14 as Ace
-computerKind (integer) computer's card kind, number between 0-3, 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs
-humanValue (integer) computer's card value,a number between 2-14,11 as Jack, 12 as Queen, 13 as King, and 14 as Ace
-humanKind (integer) computer's card kind,number between 0-3, 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs
-playAgain (character) 'Y' for yes or 'N' for no.


3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules

***generation of random number
40 generate a random number between 2 to 14
41 set computerValue = (generated random number)
42 generate a random number between 0 to 3
43 set computerKind = (generated random number)
44 generate a random number between 2 to 14
45 set humanValue = (generated random number)
46 generate a random number between 0 to 3
47 set humanKind = (generated random number)

***output cards value and kind
50 output "Human's card is a "
60 if (humanValue == 11) then output "Jack" and skip to line 70, otherwise skip to next line
61 if (humanValue == 12) then output "Queen" and skip to line 70, otherwise skip to next line
62 if (humanValue == 13) then output "King" and skip to line 70, otherwise skip to next line
63 if (humanValue == 14) then output "Ace" and skip to line 70, otherwise skip to next line
64 output humanValue
70 output " of "
71 if (humanKind == 0) then output "Spades" and skip to line 80, otherwise skip to next line
72 if (humanKind == 1) then output "Diamonds" and skip to line 80, otherwise skip to next line
73 if (humanKind == 2) then output "Hearts" and skip to line 80, otherwise skip to next line
74 if (humanKind == 3) then output "Clubs" and skip to line 80, otherwise skip to next line
80 output "Computer's card is a "
90 if (computerValue == 11) then output "Jack" and skip to line 100, otherwise skip to next line
91 if (computerValue == 12) then output "Queen" and skip to line 100, otherwise skip to next line
92 if (computerValue == 13) then output "King" and skip to line 100, otherwise skip to next line
93 if (computerValue == 14) then output "Ace" and skip to line 100, otherwise skip to next line
94 output computerValue
100 output " of "
110 if (computerKind == 0) then output "Spades" and skip to line 120, otherwise skip to next line
111 if (computerKind == 1) then output "Diamonds" and skip to line 120, otherwise skip to next line
112 if (computerKind == 2) then output "Hearts" and skip to line 120, otherwise skip to next line
113 if (computerKind == 3) then output "Clubs" and skip to line 120, otherwise skip to next line

***output winner decision
120 if (computerValue > humanValue) then output "Computer wins!" then skip to line 130
121 if (humanValue > computerValue) then output "Human wins!" then skip to line 130
122 if (computerValue == humanValue) then output "It's a tie!" then return to line 40
130 output "Want to play again?"
140 input playAgain
150 if (playAgain == 'Y' or 'y') then return to line 40
160 if (playAgain == 'N' or 'n') then skip to line 999
170 output "Invalid input, please try again" and return to line 130
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
purpose: Test a simple case with an tie and a invalid input for tryAgain.
input values: 'K','n'
