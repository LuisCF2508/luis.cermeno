1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Calculate the remaining range of a car given its gas capacity, distance travelled, and gallons used

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):

INPUT (any data items to be input):
-maxCap: maximum gallon capacity of the user's car.
-distanceTravelled: distance already travelled by the user.
-gallonsUsed: gallon already used in the trip. 

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. console input
4. calculation of efficiency and range.
efficiency = distanceTravelled / gallonsUsed
range = efficiency * (maxCap - gallonsUsed)
5. console output of results

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: "Objective: Calculate the remaining range of a car given its gas capacity, distance travelled, and gallons used. Author: Luis Cermeno"
-user instruction: "You will be asked to enter some information about your trip. After you type your answers, please hit the ENTER or RETURN key."
-prompt: "Enter the maximum gallon capacity of your car [e.g. 14]:"
-prompt: "How many miles have you already travelled? [e.g. 190.5]:"
-prompt: "How many gallons have you already used? [e.g. 7.1]:"
-label: "Your car has an efficiency of " and efficiency " miles per gallon, which will allow you to travel approximately " and range " miles more."

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-maxCap (decimal): maximum gallon capacity of the user's car.
-distanceTravelled (decimal): distance already travelled by the user.
-gallonsUsed (decimal): gallon already used in the trip. 
-efficiency (decimal): the miles per gallon ratio of the car.
-range (decimal): the remaining miles the car can travel.

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
Purpose:
-Test a basic case: Considering a 381 mile trip from SF to LA in a Honda CRV 2019 (specs: eff. 27mpg, cap. 14gal). The user is halfway and wants to know whether he is going to make it or not. 
Input values:
-maxCap = 14
-distanceTravelled = 190.5
-gallonsUsed = 7.1
Expected output:
-"Your car has an efficiency of 26.83 miles per gallon, which will allow you to travel approximately 186.13 miles more."
Execution:
10 maxCap declared
20 distanceTravelled declared
30 gallonsUsed declared
40 efficiency declared
50 range declared
30 Objective: Calculate the remaining range of a car given its gas capacity, distance travelled, and gallons used. Author: Luis Cermeno Author: Luis Cermeno.
40 You will be asked to enter some information about your trip. After you type your answers, please hit the ENTER or RETURN key.
50 Enter the maximum gallon capacity of your car [e.g. 14]:
55 14
60 How many miles have you already travelled? [e.g. 190.5]:
65 190.5
70 How many gallons have you already used? [e.g. 7.1]:
75 7.1
80 set efficiency = 190.5/7.1 = 26.831...
90 set range = 26.831... * (14 - 7.1) = 26.831... * 6.9 = 185.134...
100 Your car has an efficiency of 26.83 miles per gallon, which will allow you to travel approximately 185.13 miles more.
999 END
Comments:
-Succesfull execution with expected result. The user now knows he will need to fill up his tank before reaching LA.

Test case #2:
Purpose:
-Test a basic case: Considering a 381 mile trip from SF to LA in a Ford F-150 Supercrew (specs: eff. 20mpg, cap. 26gal). The user is halfway and wants to know whether he is going to make it or not. 
Input values:
-maxCap = 26
-distanceTravelled = 190.5
-gallonsUsed = 7.4
Expected output:
-"Your car has an efficiency of 25.74 miles per gallon, which will allow you to travel approximately 478.82 miles more."
Execution:
10 maxCap declared
20 distanceTravelled declared
30 gallonsUsed declared
40 efficiency declared
50 range declared
