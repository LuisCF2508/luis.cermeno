1. Create a file movieData.txt of your favorite movies and what year they were created: movie title on one line and year it was made on next line followed by a blank line.

2. Write the following algorithm and program using any data structures we have learned:

2a. myMovies-algorithm.txt
2b. myMovies.cpp

Objective: Input any number of movie titles and year each movie was created from file movieData.txt and store on a list,
then randomly select a movie and a year from the list, output the title,
and ask the user for what year that movie was made,
output whether the user got the year correct, otherwise output the correct year,
and keep score how many movie years user got correct,
ask user whether they want to keep playing the game until the user says N,
then ask the user if they want to add another movie title and year to the list, which needs to be appended to the file movieData.txt.

subprograms:
introduction- output objective, author, compiler, editor, filename, and user instructions

inputMovies- read movie.txt input file and create a list of movies and year created

askMovie- randomly pick a movie from the list and output a movie title to the user and ask user what year that movie was made,
input user guess, determine if user got it right, otherwise output to the user what year the movie was made,
return whether the user got the question right or wrong.

yOrN- ask the user to play again or ask the user if they want to add another movie to the list,
with input validation of Y or N, and return Y or N

sortList- sort list of movies with year

outputList- output the list, lining up all the years after each movie title on each line.

3. Please submit the following files:

myMovies-algorithm.txt
myMovies.cpp
