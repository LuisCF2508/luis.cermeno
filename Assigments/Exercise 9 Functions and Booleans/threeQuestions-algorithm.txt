1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Ask three computer science questions and then show their final score.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, dat1):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userAnswer


PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. ask question and update score
4. output final score


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt: "Q1.Which one is a programming language?: 1)html 2)java 3)binary"
-prompt: "Q2.Which loop is count controlled?: 1) while-true 2) for"
-prompt: "Q3.How do you call the name of variables?: 1)label 2)parameter 3)identifier"
-output: "Correct!"
-output: "Very good,but a better answer is " and correctAnswer
-output: "TOTAL SCORE: " and userScore " out of 3."

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-question (text) one computer science question <main>
-correctAnswer (integer) the correct answer for each question <subprogram askQuestion>
-userAnswer (integer) the answer input by the user <subprogram askQuestion>
-userScore (integer) the number of correct answer the user has gotten. <main>
-result (boolean) whether the user got the answe correct, true or false <subprogram askQuestion>


3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set userScore = 0;
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***ask each question and update score
40 set correctAnswer = 2
41 set result = false
42 set question = "Q1.Which one is a programming language?: 1)html 2)java 3)binary"
43 output question
44 input userAnswer
45 if userAnswer equals to correctAnswer then set result to true
46 if result is false then output "Very good,but a better answer is " and correctAnswer and then skip to line 50
47 if result is true then output "Correct!"
48 userScore = userScore + 1

50 set correctAnswer = 2
51 set result = false
52 set question = "Q2.Which loop is count controlled?: 1) while-true 2) for"
53 output question
54 input userAnswer
55 if userAnswer equals to correctAnswer then set result to true
56 if result is false then output "Very good,but a better answer is " and correctAnswer and then skip to line 60
57 if result is true then output "Correct!"
58 userScore = userScore + 1

60 set correctAnswer = 3
61 set result = false
62 set question "Q3.How do you call the name of variables?: 1)label 2)parameter 3)identifier"
63 output question
64 input userAnswer
65 if userAnswer equals to correctAnswer then set result to true
66 if result is false then output "Very good,but a better answer is " and correctAnswer and then skip to line 70
67 if result is true then output "Correct!"
68 userScore = userScore + 1

***output final score
70 output "TOTAL SCORE: " and userScore " out of 3."

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
purpose: test a simply execution with one incorrect answer
input: 1 2 3
expected result: ""TOTAL SCORE: 2 out of 3."
execution:

10 userScore = 0;
