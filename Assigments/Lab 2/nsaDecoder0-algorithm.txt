1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Prompt the user to enter a line of text, of any length, with spaces and punctuation. Then "decode" the entered text so that each character is converted to the previous character in the ASCII code. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-userText

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. user input
4. decoding
5. output decoded text

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt "Please enter a line of text [E.g. Hello, World]: "
-label "Text Decoded: " and value of userText

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-userText //(text) the text to decode entered by the user 
-i //(integer) counter for the decoding main loop 

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data definitions
10 set userText as text data
15 set i = 0
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***user input
30 output "Please enter a line of text [E.g. Hello, World]: "
40 input userText
***decoding
50 if i < userText lenght then continue, otherwise skip to line 70
55 convert character "i" of userText to character "i + 1"
56 i = i - 1
60 go back to line 50
***output decoded text
70 output "Text Decoded: " and value of userText

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: test a simply case.
input: "Ifmmp"
expected result: "Text Decoded: Hello"
execution:
10 userText declared as text data
15 i = 0
20 Objective:Prompt the user to enter a line of text, of any length, with spaces and punctuation. Then "decode" the entered text so that each character is converted to the next character in the ASCII code. Author:
30 Please enter a line of text [E.g. Hello, World]:
40 Ifmmp (lenght : 5)
