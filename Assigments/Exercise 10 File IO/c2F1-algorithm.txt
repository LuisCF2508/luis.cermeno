1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
- This program will Celcius to Farenheit degrees from a list extracted from a text file named  temps.txt.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
F = 9 / 5 * C + 32

INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-dCel

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. file input and output
  3.1 read each line of the file
  3.2 calculation
  3.3 output

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-output : "Celcius: " and value of dCel " is " Farenheit: " and value of dFar

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-dCel (decimal) Celcius degrees extracted from text file
-dFar (decimal) Farenheit degrees extracted from text file

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 data declaration
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***file input and output
30 open temp.txt
31 if file is invalid pop up a run-time error message
****read each line

40 read line for the file and if end-of-file is reached skip to line 999
41 set dCel = (value read)
42 if dCel is equal -999 then skip to line 999
****calculation
50 set dFar = ((9.0/5) * dCel) + 32
****output
60 output "Celcius: " and value of dCel " is " Farenheit: " and value of dFar(with only 2 decimal places)
70 go back to line 40 but this time read next line in the text file
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
-purpose: test a simple case using a list without the sentinel value -999.
-input file:
0
15
25
-expected results:
Celcius: 0 is Farenheit: 32.00
Celcius: 15 is Farenheit: 59.00
Celcius: 25 is Farenheit: 77.00
-execution:

31 False
40 0
41 set dCel = 0
42 False
50 dFar = ((9.0/5) * 0) + 32 = 32.00
60 Celcius: 0 is Farenheit: 32
40 15
41 set dCel = 15
42 False
50 dFar = ((9.0/5) * 15) + 32 = 59
60 Celcius: 15 is Farenheit: 59.00
40 25
41 set dCel = 25
42 False
50 dFar = ((9.0/5) * 25) + 32 = 77
60 Celcius: 25 is Farenheit: 77.00
40 True
999 END
-comments: test successfully executed with expected results.


Test case #2: 
-purpose: another case using a floating point number as input AND using the sentinel -999
-input file:
23.34
-999
-expected results: 
Celcius: 23.34 is Farenheit: 74.01
-execution:
