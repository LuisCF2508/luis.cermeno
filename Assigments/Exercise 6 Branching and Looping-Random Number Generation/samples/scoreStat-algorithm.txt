1. Objective: Input scores [0-100] from the user until the sentinnel value of -999 is input and then calculate the average, minimum, maximum of those numbers.

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
-score [0-100] from the user from the keyboard.

PROCESSING:
-keep inputing scores [0-100] until -999 is input by the user from the keyboard
-count each input score
-sum each input score
-update minimum if input number is less than current minimum
-update maximum if input number is more than current maximum
-average = sum / count

OUTPUT:
-objective 
-author
-prompt "Please enter a score between 0 and 100 or -999 to exit 
-count and input number (not for sentinnel value)
-output label for average and the calculated average
-output label for minimum and the calculated minimum
-output label for maximum and the calculated maximum

DATA:
-decimal n = input number
-decimal average = (initally 0)  calculated average
-decimal min = (initially first number input) smallest number of the input numbers
-decimal max = (initally first number input) largest number of the input numbers
-integer count = (initially 0) number of numbers
-decimal sum = (initally 0) sum of numbers
