1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): randomly generate 3 random integers between 1 and 10, and sum those 3 numbers, and output the 3 random numbers and the sum, 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-n1
-n2
-n3

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data preparation
2. user introduction
3. generate 3 random numbers between 1 and 10 and sum them
4. output appropriately labeled 3 random numbers and the sum

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-n1 (integer) randomly generated between 1 and 10
-n2 (integer) randomly generated between 1 and 10
-n3 (integer) randomly generated between 1 and 10
-sum (integer) total of n1, n2, and n3

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***introduction and data preparation
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
*** generate 3 random numbers between 1 and 10 and sum them
20 set n1 to randomly generated number between 1 and 10
30 set n2 to randomly generated number between 1 and 10
40 set n3 to randomly generated number between 1 and 10
50 set sum = n1 + n2 + n3
***output appropriately labeled 3 random numbers and the sum
60 output n1 and " + " and n2 and " + " and n3 and " = " and sum

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: input: n1 = 3, n2 = 5, n3 = 1 and expected results: 3 + 5 + 1 = 9
10 This will randomly generate 3 random integers between 1 and 10, and sum those 3 numbers, and output the 3 random numbers and the sum
20 n1=3
30 n2=5
40 n3=1
50 sum=3+5+1=9
60 3 + 5 + 1 = 9
999 END

Test case #2:
