1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Add, subtract, multiplicate or divide two numbers.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-number1
-number2
-operation
-sentinel

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. loop where the user either inputs their numbers and operation, or quits the program.

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: "Objective: Add,subtract,multiplicate or divide two numbers.Author: Luis Cermeno"
-prompt: "Please enter first number: "
-prompt: "Please enter second number: "
-prompt: "Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]:"
-label : number1 "(operation symbol)" number 2 "=" result
-prompt: "Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]:"

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-number1 (integer) the first number of the arithmetic operation.
-number2 (integer) the second number of the arithmetic operation.
-operation (integer) the arithmetical operation the user want to calculate, being 1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division.
-result (integer) the result of the arithmetical calculation.
-sentinel (character) a letter 'Y' or 'N' that indicates whether or not the user wants to do another calculation.

***loop where the user either inputs their numbers and operator, or quits the program.
20 output prompt: "Please enter first number: "
30 input number1
40 output prompt: "Please enter second number: "
50 input number2
60 output prompt: "Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]:"
70 input operation
75 if operation is less than 1 or greater than 4, then output "Invalid input, please try again..."
76 if operation is less than 1 or greater than 4, then skip to line 60
80 if operation is equal to 1, then set result = number1 + number2 
85 if operation is equal to 1, then output: number1 "+" number 2 "=" result
90 if operation is equal to 2, then set result = number1 - number2
95 if operation is equal to 2, then output: number1 "-" number 2  "=" result
100 if operation is equal to 3, then set result = number1 * number2 
105 if operation is equal to 3, then output: number1 "*" number 2 "=" result
110 if operation is equal to 4, then set result = number1 / number2 and 
115 if operation is equal to 4, then output: number1 "/" number 2 "=" result
120 output prompt: "Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]:"
130 input sentinel.
140 if sentinel is equal to 'Y' then skip to line 20
150 if sentinel is equal to 'N' then skip to line 999, otherwise output: "Invalid character, please try again..." and then skip to line 120

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
-Purpose: test each arithmetical operation.
-Input values (number1,number2,operation,sentinel) : (3,2,1,Y) ; (3,2,2,Y); (3,2,3,Y); (6,2,4,N)
-Expected results: 3 + 2 = 5, 3 - 2 = 1, 3 * 2 = 6, 6 / 2 = 3.
