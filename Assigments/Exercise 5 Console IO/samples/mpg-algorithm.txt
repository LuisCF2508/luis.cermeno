1. Objective: calculate the miles/gallon depending on user input of fuel tank capacity, miles driven, and gallons of fuel used.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
-fuelTankCapacity
-milesDriven
-gallonsUsed


PROCESSING:
1. input from user fuelTankCapacity, milesDriven, gallonsUsed
2. calculate mpg = milesDriven / gallonsUsed
3. calculate fuelRemaining = fuelTankCapacity - gallonsUsed
4. calculate range = fuelRemaining * mpg
5. output mpg, fuelRemaining, range with labels

OUTPUT:
-objective
-author
-date/time
-prompt "How many gallons fuel does your vehicle tank hold? "
-prompt "How many miles did you drive your vehicle? "
-prompt "How many gallons used on this trip? "
-label "Your fuel tank capacity is " and fuelTankCapacity
-label "Miles driven: " and milesDriven
-label "Gallons used on this trip: " and gallonsUsed
-label "MPG: " and mpg
-label "Fuel remaining in fuel tank: " and fuelRemaining and " gallons"
-label "Range of vehicle with fuel remaining: " and range

DATA:
-fuelTankCapacity = how many gallons fuel tank holds (integer)
-milesDriven = how many miles did the user drive (decimal)
-gallonsUsed = how many gallons of fuel used on trip (decimal)
-mpg = miles per gallon vehicle performance on trip (decimal)
-range = miles you can drive based on fuel remaining in tank (decimal)
-fuelRemaining = gallons of fuel left in the tank after trip (decimal)

Test Case#1: input: fuelTankCapacity=23, milesDriven = 250, gallonsUsed=21   Expected results:
mpg= 11.9
fuelRemaining = 2
range = 23.8

40 How many gallons fuel does your vehicle tank hold? 
50 fuelTankCapacity = 23
60 How many miles did you drive your vehicle? 
70 milesDriven = 250
80 How many gallons used on this trip? 
90 gallonsUsed=21
100 mpg = milesDriven / gallonsUsed = 250 / 21 = 11.9
110 fuelRemaining = fuelTankCapacity - gallonsUsed = 23 - 21 = 2
120 range = fuelRemaining * mpg = 2 * 11.9 = 23.8
130 Your fuel tank capacity is 23
140 Miles driven: 250
150 Gallons used on this trip: 21
160 MPG: 11.9
170 Fuel remaining in fuel tank: 2 gallons
180 Range of vehicle with fuel remaining: 23.8

Test Case #2: What if we run out of fuel?



Test Case #3: No fuel remaining
