1. Objective: Determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-height = height of the lighthouse entered by the user

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. user input of height
4. calculation of distance
distance=sqrt(0.8*height)
5. output value of distance and height

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: "Objective: Determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. .Author: Luis Cermeno"
-user instruction: "You will be asked to enter the height of the lighthouse, please type the value with your keyboard and press ENTER key once you complete your input"
-prompt "What's the lighthouse height in feet? [55.5]:"
-label output "A " and height (with any decimal the user has input) " foot tall lighthouse can be seen from " and distance(rounded to nearest whole number) " miles away".

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
height (decimal) height of the lighthouse entered by the user.
distance (decimal) maximun distance from what the lighthouse can be seen, calculated by the program.

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)	
***data
10 declare height
20 declare distance
***introduction 
30 output introduction: "Objective: Determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. .Author: Luis Cermeno"
35 output instruction: "You will be asked to enter the height of the lighthouse, please type the value with your keyboard and press ENTER key once you complete your input"
***user input of height
40 prompt "What's the lighthouse height in feet? [55.5]:"
50 input height
***calculation of distance
60 set distance = sqrt(0.8*height)
***output value of distance and height
70 output "A " and height (with any decimal the user has input) " foot tall lighthouse can be seen from " and distance(rounded to nearest whole number) " miles away".

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1:
-purpose:
test the algorithm with basic case (given example)
-input values:
height = 100.001
-expected result
"A 100.001 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away".
-execution:
10 height declared 
20 distance declared
30 Objective: Determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea.Author: Luis Cermeno
35 You will be asked to enter the height of the lighthouse, please type the value with your keyboard and press ENTER key once you complete your input
40 What's the lighthouse height in feet? [55.5]
50 100.001
60 distance = sqrt(0.8*100.001) = 8.944
70 A 100.001 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away.

Test case #2: 
-purpose:
test the algorithm with basic case (program given example)
-input values:
height = 55.5
-expected result
"A 55.5 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 7 miles away".
-execution:
10 height declared
