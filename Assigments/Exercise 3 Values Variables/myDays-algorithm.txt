1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Calculate how many days old a person would be by the due date of this assignment.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-dateOfBirth
-dueDate
-yearsLived
-nLeapYears
-nDaysBY
-nDaysRemaining

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. input yearsLived, nLeapYears, nDaysBY, nDaysRemaining
4. calculate how many days olds the person will be by the due date of this assignment
5. output values of DdateOfBirth, dueDate, days

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-label "Date of Birth: " and dateOfBirth
-label "Due Date: " and dueDate
-label "Age in days: " and nDaysBY

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-dateOfBirth (string) person's date of birth [month, date, year].
-dueDate (string) assignment due date [month, date, year].
-days (integer) how many days old a person would be by the due date of the assignment.
-yearslived (integer) the number of years in which you've lived, including your birth year and the due date year.
-nLeapYears (integer) the number os leap years in your life.
-nDaysBY (integer) the number os days in your life.
-nDaysRemaining (integer) the number of days remaining inthe current year after de due date for this lab excluding that day.

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data definitions
10 set dateOfBirth = "May 31, 1993"
20 set dueDate = "September 20, 2014"
30 set days = 0
***user introduction 
40 output "Objective: Calculate how many days old a person would be by the due date of this assignment. Author: Luis Cermeno."
***input yearsLived, nLeapYears, nDaysBY, nDaysRemaining
50 set yearsLived = 22
60 set nLeapYears = 5
70 set nDaysBY = 151
80 set nDaysRemaining = 102
***calculate how many days old the person will be by the due date of this assignment
90 add to "days" the result of this multiplication: 365 times the value of yearsLived.
100 add to "days" the value of nLeapYears.
110 subtract from "days" the value of nDaysBY.
120 subtract from "days" the nDaysRemaining.
***output dateOfBirth, dueDate, days
130 output "Date of Birth: " and the value of dateOfBirth
140 output "Due Date: " and the value of dueDate
150 output "Age in days: " and the value of days
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1:
purpose: to test a ramdom simple execution (given example).

input values:
-dateOfBirth = "May 31,1993"
-dueDate = "September 20, 2014"
-yearsLived = 22
-nLeapYears = 5
-nDaysBY = 151
-nDaysRemaining = 102

execution:
10 set dateOfBirth = "May 31, 1993"
20 set dueDate = "September 20, 2014"
30 set days = 0
40 output "Objective: Calculate how many days old a person would be by the due date of this assignment. Author: Luis Cermeno."
50 set yearsLived = 22
60 set nLeapYears = 5
70 set nDaysBY = 151
80 set nDaysRemaining = 102
90 days = days + (365 * yearsLived) = 0 + 8030 = 8030
100 days = days +  nLeapYears = 8030 + 5 = 8035
110 days = days - nDaysBY = 8035 - 151 = 7884 
120 days = days - nDaysRemaining = 7884 - 102 = 7782
130 Date of Birth: May 31, 1993
140 Due Date: September 20, 2014
150 Age in days: 7782
999 END

comments: 
The program output the expected result. Successful execution.

Test case #2: 
purpose: to test a ramdom simple execution (personal example).

input values:
-dateOfBirth = "August 25,1999"
-dueDate = "February 13, 2020"
-yearsLived = 20
-nLeapYears = 6
-nDaysBY = 237
-nDaysRemaining = 322

execution:
10 set dateOfBirth = "August 25,1999"
20 set dueDate = "February 13, 2020"
30 set days = 0
40 output "Objective: Calculate how many days old a person would be by the due date of this assignment. Author: Luis Cermeno."
50 set yearsLived = 22
60 set nLeapYears = 6
70 set nDaysBY = 237
80 set nDaysRemaining = 322
90 days = days + (365 * yearsLived) = 0 + 8030 = 8030
100 days = days +  nLeapYears = 8030 + 6 = 8036
110 days = days - nDaysBY = 8036 - 237 = 7799 
120 days = days - nDaysRemaining = 7799 - 322 = 7477
130 Date of Birth: May 31, 1993
140 Due Date: September 20, 2014
150 Age in days: 7477
999 END
